"""
    buildsymplecticrepn(vqc::VQC)

Construct an matrix with entries `0,1` which is a binary symplectic representation
of the quantum state using the stabilizer formalism.

Let ``n`` be the number of qubits. The matrix is of dimension ``n \\times 2n+1``
and each row is the representation of a stabilizer ``S``.

A stabilizer ``S`` is a Pauli tensor acting on the quantum state ``\\psi`` such
that ``S\\psi = \\psi``. By declaring ``n`` independent stabilizers we have
uniquely defined the quantum state (up to an unimportant ``\\mathbb{C}^*``
projective factor).

The representation of ``S`` as a ``2n+1`` vector `V` is as follows:
- for ``1\\le k \\le n``:
    - presence of `V[k]` indicates the Pauli ``Z_k``;
    - presence of `V[n+k]` indicates the Pauli ``X_k``;
    - presence of both `V[k]` and `V[n+k]` indicates the Pauli ``Y_k``;
- `V[2n+1]` indicates a global ``\\pm 1`` factor where the integer ``s`` provides
    the factor ``(-1)^s``.
