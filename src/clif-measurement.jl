    phasedstabilizermultiplication!(stab1, stab2)

Multiply `stab1` by `stab2` modifying stab1, and update phase.

- `stab1` and `stab2` must commute to ensure that the final phase is ``\\pm 1``.
- `stab1` is replaced with `stab1 * stab2` and **not** `stab2 * stab1`.
- rules are as follows:
    - `phase` initialized to `0 (mod 4)`;
    - ``Z_k \\circ X_k`` gives ``Y_k`` and `phase += 1`;
    - other Paulis are inferred from this rule;
    - final phase is addition of `phase` with `stab1` `stab2` phases.
